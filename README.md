My portfolio is still in its beginning stages, it would have been faster to create a frontend site but I wanted to create a full stack app. I have been experiencing difficulty finishing because of a long move after graduation due to family emergency. Still setting up internet and electricity for apartment and staying with family currently. Having tiny mental breakdowns due to these obstacles but working through it all one day at a time.
